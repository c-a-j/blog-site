#### Install vim
Check if vim is already installed.

```shell
vim --version
```

If vim isn't found, you'll need to install it.

```shell
sudo apt install vim
```

As of the time of writing this, the lastest version is 8.2. If you'd like to
upgrade to the latest version, use `apt`.

```shell
sudo apt upgrade vim
```
