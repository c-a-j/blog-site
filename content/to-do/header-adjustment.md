#### h4
##### h5

Issues
* regular text is larger than h5. Should be equal or larger.
* header color is the same as links, should probably be a shade of grey/white
* not a big fan of the asterisks, look into alternatives


Solutions
* Changed header color
    * `heading_color = "#d4d5d6"` in `data/theme.toml`
* Changed body font color
    * `body_color = "#c1c3c5"` in `data/theme.toml`
